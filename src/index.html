      <h2>What is a camera?</h2>

      <p>
      The camera has quickly become one of the most widely-used inventions of all time. In fact, despite being around for a couple hundred years there are more cameras used today than ever before.
      </p>

      <p>
      But there is a lot more to a camera than just taking pressing a button to get a picture. Fancy DSLR cameras confront you with a huge array of options, most of them unintelligible to the average user. Although the terms sound confusing, they aren't too hard to grasp if you understand how cameras work. Let's explain how and why cameras are they way they are from first principles.

      <h2>Zooming into the pinhole camera</h2>
      <p>
      In the following demo, we'll explain how the most basic camera works. Then, we'll learn about how cameras zoom in and out of a picture.
      </p>

      <p>You can drag your mouse in the scene to rotate it. Try it out!</p>

      <div class="demo" id="cameras-fov"></div>

      <div class="notes">
        <p class="slide slide-1">
        Here we have a little square that does something pretty simple.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-2">
        When a blue ray of light hits it, it records blue.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-3">
        If a red ray of light hits it, it records magenta (the combination of red and blue).
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-4">
        We call each of these squares a pixel. If we make a big grid out of these pixels, we have a full-blown image sensor...
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-5">
        ...and in we can get the right light rays to hit the right spots on the sensor, we can get an image! This is basically how cameras record images.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-6">
        Our first thought might be to just stick the sensor in front of something we want to take a picture of, like this block tree. This, however, won't work, because...
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-7">
        ...each pixel on the sensor will get rays from the top of the tree...
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-8">
        ...as well as the bottom.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-9">
        Since each pixel gets all the rays from all parts of the tree, the final image will just be a single color. No good. (In reality, if you did this the image would be completely white since each pixel would be flooded with light from everywhere, not just the tree).
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-10">
        So how do we make an actual image on the sensor? We want each pixel on the sensor to receive light from a single spot on the image. One way of doing this is to cover up the sensor to only let light in through one spot. This is called a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pinhole_camera" target="_blank">pinhole camera</a>, and you can easily make one yourself using a shoebox if you'd like.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-11">
        Each ray of light needs to go through the pinhole to get to the sensor. Here's a ray from the tree leaves...
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-12">
        And another.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-13">
        Here's one from the trunk.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-14">
        And another.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-15">
        Lo and behold! We have an image. You'll notice that the image is upside down. This is a natural effect of using a pinhole camera. In fact, your eyes produce upside-down images too! It's just that your brain processes them right-side-up.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-16">
        You might have noticed that the image cuts off big portions of the tree. Why is that the case?
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-17">
        Well, if we trace a ray from the top of the tree through the pinhole it completely misses the sensor.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-18">
        Same goes for the bottom. Any ray that doesn't hit the sensor doesn't get recorded. How can we get the entire tree into the frame?
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-19">
        One easy way is to just increase the sensor size.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-20">
        Now we're in business. Unfortunately, actual cameras can't adjust their sensor sizes on the fly.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-21">
        But, we can do something else. Notice how the rays miss the sensor?
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-22">
        If we just move the sensor forward, now the rays hit the sensor.
        </p>
        <p class="slide slide-23">
        Now we have the entire tree on the sensor! This is how we adjust <em>zoom</em>, or how much of the scene is in the camera image. This is also known as field-of-view (FOV). We can increase the FOV by increasing the sensor size or by moving the sensor closer to the pinhole.

      <h2>Lens it up</h2>
      <p>In this demo, we'll explain why cameras use lenses. Then, we'll explain why using a lens often causes some parts of the image to be in focus while other parts aren't.</p>
